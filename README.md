# University Attendance System Analysis and Design

The University Attendance System Analysis and Design project presents a comprehensive system designed to efficiently manage attendance tracking for both students and employees within a university environment. This project encompasses detailed analysis and thoughtful design of a system that automates attendance monitoring, warning generation, user interaction, and administrative functions.

## Project Overview

The primary objective of the University Attendance System is to accurately track attendance records for students and employees. The system automatically issues warnings to users who miss a predefined number of attendance instances. Users can submit their attendance by scanning their unique IDs, and each user has a personalized account to access their attendance history and other related information.

## Key Features

- **Attendance Tracking**: The system records attendance for students and employees through ID scanning.

- **Automated Warning System**: The system generates warnings automatically for users who miss a specified number of attendance instances.

- **User Interaction**: Each user (employee or student) can access their attendance data, view issued warnings, and submit specific actions like requesting work excuses or filing complaints.

- **Administrative Functions**: Admin accounts are equipped with various functionalities, including viewing, modifying, and adding user data, generating reports on attendance and warnings, managing work excuses, and handling student complaints.

## Diagrams Included

1. **Use Case Diagram**: Visual representation of the interactions between system users and the system itself.

2. **DFD Diagrams**:
   - Context Diagram: An overview of the system's interaction with external entities.
   - Level 0 Diagram: A high-level view of the system's processes.
   - Level 1 Diagram: Detailed diagrams showcasing system processes and data flows.

3. **Class Diagram**: Illustration of the system's classes and their relationships.

4. **Sequence Diagrams**:
   - (request_work_Excuse): Depicting the sequence of steps when an employee requests a work excuse.
   - (complain_about_warning): Illustrating the sequence of actions when a student files a complaint about a warning.

## Learning Objectives

By engaging in the University Attendance System Analysis and Design project, participants will achieve the following:

- Develop a solid understanding of system analysis and design processes.
- Learn to translate complex real-world scenarios into functional system requirements.
- Acquire skills in creating various diagrams for visualizing system interactions and processes.
- Gain insight into user interaction and administrative functionalities in software systems.

## Outcome

Upon completion, participants will have a well-documented and designed University Attendance System that demonstrates their ability to analyze, design, and visualize software systems. This project provides a practical showcase of skills in system design and diagrammatic representation, which are highly valuable in the field of software engineering and application development.
